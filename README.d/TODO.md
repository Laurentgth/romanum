## BACKLOG

-   [ ] Change 'decimal' to 'Arabic' wherever it is not done.

-   [ ] In the conversion rule stating that when a figure of lesser value comes right before (on the left) a figure of greater value a subtraction should be made, disallow subtractions between ranges of number that do not follow each other, e.g. "IC" does not exist and should not be converted to "99", whereas "XC" must indeed yield "90".
